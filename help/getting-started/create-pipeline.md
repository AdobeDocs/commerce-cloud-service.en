# Set up a pipeline

A _pipeline_ executes a set of instructions for building and deploying the Commerce application. Git branches and environments play an important part in the CICD process.

There are three types of pipelines:

- **Build + Deployment**—Select an environment and build and deploy the existing code.

- **Build only**—Select a Git branch and create a _build artifact_ with a unique ID.

- **Deployment only**—Select a target environment to deploy a build artifact.
