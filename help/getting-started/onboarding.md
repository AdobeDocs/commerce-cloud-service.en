# Onboarding

## Adobe Identity

Adobe creates an Organization ID for your company. Every user must have an Adobe ID and must be a member of your Organization before you can grant them access to your Commerce program.

## Users and roles

The _Admin Console_ provides pre-defined roles that can be assigned at the Commerce Program level. As a Business Owner and Commerce Admin manager, you can manage user access to each program you provision, and you can manage the level of access a user has within a Commerce Program.

The following table lists the available Commerce roles and the jobs they can perform:

Role | Jobs |
