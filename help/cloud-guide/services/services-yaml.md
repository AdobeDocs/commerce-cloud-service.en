# Configure services

The `services.yaml` file defines the services supported and used by Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, such as MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch or OpenSearch. You do not need to subscribe to external service providers. 

>[!NOTE]: The .magento/services.yaml file is managed locally in the `.magento` directory of your project. The configuration is accessed during the build process for defining the required service versions in the integration environent only, and gets removed once the deployment has been completed, so you will not find them on the server.


The deploy script uses the configuration files in the `.magento` directory to provision the environment with the configured services. A service becomes available to your application if it is included in the [`relationships`](../application/properties.md#relationships) property of the `.magento.app.yaml` file. The `services.yaml` file contains the _type_ and _disk_ values. Service type defines the service _name_ and _version_.

Changing a service configuration causes a deployment to provision the environment with the updated services, which affects the following environments:

- All Starter environments including Production `master`
- Pro integration environments

{{pro-update-service}}

## Default and supported services

The cloud infrastructure supports and deploys the following services:

- [MySQL](mysql.md)
- [Redis](redis.md)
- [RabbitMQ](rabbitmq.md)
- [Elasticsearch](elasticsearch.md)
- [OpenSearch](opensearch.md)

You can view default versions and disk values in the current, [default `services.yaml` file](https://github.com/magento/magento-cloud/blob/master/.magento/services.yaml). The following sample shows the `mysql`, `redis`, `opensearch` or `elasticsearch`, and `rabbitmq` services defined in the `services.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
mysql:
    type: mysql:10.4
    disk: 5120

redis:
    type: redis:6.2

opensearch:
    type: opensearch:2  # minor version not required; uses latest
    disk: 1024

rabbitmq:
    type: rabbitmq:3.9
    disk: 1024
```

## Service values

You must provide the service ID and service type configuration `type: <name>:<version>`. If the service uses persistent storage, then you must provide a disk value.

Use the following format:

```yaml
<service-id>:
    type: <name>:<version>
    disk: <value-MB>
```

### `service-id`

The `service-id` value identifies the service in the project. You can only use lowercase alphanumeric characters: `a` to `z` and `0` to `9`, such as `redis`.

This _service-id_ value is used in the [`relationships`](../application/properties.md#relationships) property of the `.magento.app.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
relationships:
    redis: "<name>:redis"
```

You can name multiple instances of each service type. For example, you could use multiple Redis instancesâ€”one for session and one for cache.

```yaml
redis:
    type: redis:<version>

redis2:
    type: redis:<version>
```

Renaming a service in the `services.yaml` file **permanently removes** the following:

- The existing service before creating a service with the new name you specify.
- All existing data for the service is removed. Adobe strongly recommends that you [backup your Starter environment](../storage/snapshots.md) before you change the name of an existing service.

### `type`

The `type` value specifies the service name and version. For example:

```yaml
mysql:
    type: mysql:10.4
```

### `disk`

The `disk` value specifies the size of the persistent disk storage (in MB) to allocate to the service. Services that use persistent storage, such as MySQL, must provide a disk value. Services that use memory instead of persistent storage, such as Redis, do not require a disk value.

```yaml
mysql:
    type: mysql:10.4
    disk: 5120
```

The current default storage amount per project is 5 GB, or 512 0MB. You can distribute this amount between your application and each of its services.

## Service relationships

In Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure projects, service [relationships](../application/properties.md#relationships) configured in the `.magento.app.yaml` file determine which services are available to your application.

You can retrieve the configuration data for all service relationships from the [`$MAGENTO_CLOUD_RELATIONSHIPS`](../environment/variables-cloud.md) environment variable. The configuration data includes service name, type, and version along with any required connection details such as port number and login credentials.

**To verify relationships in local environment**:

1. In your local environment, show the relationships for the active environment.

   ```bash
   magento-cloud relationships
   ```

1. Confirm the `service` and `type` from the response. The response provides connection information, such as the IP address and port number.

   >Abbreviated sample response

   ```terminal
   redis:
       -
   ...
           type: 'redis:7.0'
           port: 6379
   elasticsearch:
       -
   ...
           type: 'opensearch:2'
           port: 9200
   database:
       -
   ...
           type: 'mysql:10.6'
           port: 3306
   ```

**To verify relationships in remote environments**:

1. Use SSH to log in to the remote environment.

1. List the relationships configuration data for all services configured in the environment.

   ```bash
   echo $MAGENTO_CLOUD_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 -d | json_pp
   ```

   or, use the following `ece-tools` command to view relationships:

   ```bash
   php ./vendor/bin/ece-tools env:config:show services
   ```

1. Confirm the `service` and `type` from the response. The response provides connection information, such as the IP address and port number and any required username and password credentials.

## Service versions

Service version and compatibility support for Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure is determined by versions deployed and tested on the Cloud infrastructure, and sometimes differ from versions supported by Adobe Commerce on-premises deployments. See [System requirements](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/installation-guide/system-requirements.html) in the _Installation_ guide for a list of third-party software dependencies that Adobe has tested with specific Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source releases.

### Software EOL checks

During the deployment process, the `ece-tools` package checks installed service versions against the end-of-life (EOL) dates for each service.

- If a service version is within three months of the EOL date, a notification displays in the deploy log.
- If the EOL date is in the past, a warning notification displays.

To maintain store security, update installed software versions before they reach EOL. You can review the EOL dates in the [ece-tools' `eol.yaml` file](https://github.com/magento/ece-tools/blob/develop/config/eol.yaml).

### Migrate to OpenSearch

{{elasticsearch-support}}

For Adobe Commerce version 2.4.4 and later, see [Set up OpenSearch service](opensearch.md).

## Change service version

You can upgrade the installed service version for compatibility with the Adobe Commerce version deployed in your Cloud environment.

You cannot downgrade the service version for an installed service directly. However, you can create a service with the required version. See [Downgrade service version](#downgrade-version).

### Upgrade installed service version

You can upgrade the installed service version by updating the service configuration in the `services.yaml` file.

1. Change the [`type`](#type) value for the service in the `.magento/services.yaml` file:

   > Original service definition

   ```yaml
   mysql:
       type: mysql:10.3
       disk: 2048
   ```

   > Updated service definition

   ```yaml
   mysql:
       type: mysql:10.4
       disk: 5120
   ```

1. Add, commit, and push your code changes.

   ```bash
   git add .magento/services.yaml
   ```

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Upgrade MySQL from MariaDB 10.3 to 10.4."
   ```

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

### Downgrade version

You cannot downgrade an installed service directly. You have two options:

1. Rename an existing service with the new version, which removes the existing service and data, and adds a new one.

1. Create a service and save the data from the existing service.

When you change the service version, you must update the service configuration in the `services.yaml` file, and update the relationships in the `.magento.app.yaml` file.

**To downgrade a service version by renaming an existing service**:

1. Rename the existing service in the `.magento/services.yaml` file and change the version.

   >[!WARNING]
   >
   >Renaming an existing service replaces it and deletes all data. If you need to retain the data, create a service instead of renaming the existing one.

   For example, to downgrade the MariaDB version for the _mysql_ service from version 10.4 to 10.3, change the existing _service-id_ and _type_ configuration.

   > Original `services.yaml` definition

     ```yaml
     mysql:
         type: mysql:10.4
         disk: 5120
     ```

   > New `services.yaml` definition

     ```yaml
     mysql2:
          type: mysql:10.3
          disk: 5120
     ```

1. Update the relationships in the `.magento.app.yaml` file.

   > Original `.magento.app.yaml` configuration

   ```yaml
   relationships:
       database: "mysql:mysql"
   ```

   > Updated `.magento.app.yaml` configuration

   ```yaml
   relationships:
       database: "mysql2:mysql"
   ```

1. Add, commit, and push your code changes.

**To downgrade a service by creating a service**:

1. Add a service definition to the `services.yaml` file for your project with the downgraded version specification. See _mysql2_ in the following example:

   > services.yaml

   ```yaml
   mysql:
       type: mysql:10.4
       disk: 5120
   mysql2:
       type: mysql:10.3
       disk: 5120
   ```

1. Change the relationships configuration in the `.magento.app.yaml` file to use the new service.

   > Original `.magento.app.yaml` configuration

     ```yaml
     relationships:
         database: "mysql:mysql"
     ```

   > New `.magento.app.yaml` configuration

     ```yaml
     relationships:
         database: "mysql2:mysql"
     ```

1. Add, commit, and push your code changes.
