# Cloud Docker for Commerce

Cloud Docker for Commerce is part of the [Cloud Tools Suite](../release-notes/cloud-tools-suite.md). The Cloud Docker tool can be used for developing and testing your Adobe Commerce on-premises or cloud infrastructure project in a local, cloud-like environment.

## Local development

The Docker environment emulates the Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure Integration environment for convenient local development and testing. You need three essential components: an Adobe Commerce v2 template, Docker Compose, and Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure `ece-tools` package.
