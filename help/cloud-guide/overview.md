# Commerce on Cloud Infrastructure

Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure provides an automated hosting platform with a **self-service** approach to building, deploying, and managing your [!DNL Commerce] application in a cloud-native environment. Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure comes with additional features that set it apart from the on-premises Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source platforms:

- A pre-provisioned infrastructure that includes PHP, MySQL (MariaDB), Redis, [!DNL RabbitMQ], and supported search engine technologies.
- Git-based workflow with automatic build and deploy for efficient Rapid development and Continuous deployment every time you push code changes in a Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment.
- Highly Customizable environment configuration files and command-line interface (CLI) manage and deploy tools.
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosting that offers a Scalable and Secure environment for online sales and retailing.
