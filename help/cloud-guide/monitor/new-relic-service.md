## New Relic APM

[New Relic for application performance management (APM)][New Relic APM] is a software analytics product that helps you analyze and improve application interactions. New Relic APM is available to all Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure projects and provides the following features:

- **Focus on specific transactions**—Actively mark and monitor key customer actions in your site, such as adding to the cart, checking out, or processing a payment.
- **Database query monitoring**—Locate and monitor database queries affecting performance.
- **App Map**—View all application dependencies within your site, extensions, and external services.
- **[!DNL Apdex] scores**—Evaluate performance and create alerts that identify issues and notify you when they occur, such as site performance affected by a flash sale or web event. See [Apdex score][].
- **Managed alerts for Adobe Commerce**–Use this New Relic alert policy to monitor application and infrastructure performance based on industry best practices. See [Monitor performance with the Managed alerts for Adobe Commerce alert policy]().

Your Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure project includes the software for the New Relic APM service along with a license key. You do not need to purchase or install any additional software.

## New Relic Infrastructure

Pro projects include the [New Relic Infrastructure (NRI)][nri] service, which automatically connects with the application data and performance analytics to provide dynamic server monitoring. This service is available on Pro Production and Staging environments.
