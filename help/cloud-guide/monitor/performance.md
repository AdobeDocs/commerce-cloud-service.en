# Performance monitoring

You can use the following services to monitor performance of your cloud environments:

- [Health notifications](../integrations/health-notifications.md)—An integration that provides a disk space alert on Starter and Pro Integration environments.
- [Observation for Adobe Commerce Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/intro.html)—Comprehensive monitoring for all Commerce sites that combines log data from multiple sources to help you better manage your Adobe Commerce site performance and diagnose issues.

## New Relic service

Monitor your Adobe Commerce performance on Staging and Production environments using the [New Relic service for performance monitoring](new-relic-service.md).

- [Adobe Managed Alerts policy](investigate-performance.md#monitor-performance-with-managed-alerts)—A policy that tracks different performance metrics. Includes a collection of alerts that set thresholds to trigger warning and critical notifications when site infrastructure or application issues affect performance.
