# Performance monitoring

You can use the following services to monitor performance of your cloud environments:

- **[Health notifications](../integrations/health-notifications.md)**–Monitor disk space on Integration environments.

- **[New Relic services for performance monitoring](new-relic.md)**–Monitor application performance on Staging and Production environments using the New Relic Application Performance Monitoring service. Additionally, on Pro Production environments, you can also use New Relic Infrastructure (NRI) for dynamic server monitoring.

## Managed Alerts

The [Managed Alerts policy](new-relic.md#monitor-performance-with-managed-alerts) tracks performance metrics. Based on industry best practices, the policy includes a collection of alerts that set thresholds to trigger warning and critical notifications when site infrastructure or application issues affect performance.
