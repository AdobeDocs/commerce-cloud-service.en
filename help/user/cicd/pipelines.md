# Pipelines

A pipeline automates the build and deploy process. There are three types of pipelines:

-  **Build-only**—Select a branch to build and create a _build artifact_ with a unique ID.
-  **Deploy-only**—Select a target environment to deploy a build artifact.
-  **Build and Deploy**—Select an environment and build and deploy what it contains.

The pipeline cannot be set up until the Git repository has at least one branch and the Program Setup is complete.
