## Commerce on Experience Cloud Infrastructure

Commerce on AEC is a fully managed hosting platform that provides a **self-service** approach to building, deploying, and managing your Commerce application (powered by Magento) in a cloud-native environment. From the Commerce Program portal, you control:

- Environment access and controls
- CICD Pipeline optimization and scheduling
- Capacity management with autoscale tooling
- Self-service stack configurations
- Performance monitoring
- Multi-application support and micro-services

## The New Commerce Experience

Use the [Commerce Getting Started guide](../getting-started/overview.md) to set up your new Cloud Manager program and begin managing your Commerce application in a cloud-native environment.

## Commerce guides {#commerce-guides}

The Commerce guides assume that you have some working knowledge and understanding of the Commerce application powered by Magento. You can refer to the Commerce Developer and User guides below:
