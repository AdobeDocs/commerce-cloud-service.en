## The New Commerce Experience

Commerce on Adobe Experience Cloud (AEC) is a fully managed hosting platform that provides a **self-service** approach to building, deploying, and managing your Commerce application (powered by Magento) in a cloud-native environment. Monolithic applications are resource-intensive and difficult to scale and serve rapidly. With the Adobe Experience Cloud ecosystem, Commerce customers gain unparalleled access to SaaS-based microservices that are rich, intelligent, and performant.

Commerce on AEC uses Unified Shell to provide productivity features and consistent interface elements to enhance the AEC user experience. Unified Shell delivers the application within an iframe on the `experience.adobe.com` URL path. From the program portal, you control:

- Environment access and controls
- CICD Pipeline optimization and scheduling
- Capacity management with autoscale tooling
- Self-service stack configurations
- Performance monitoring
- Domain management
- Multi-application support and micro-services

Use the [Commerce Getting Started guide](../getting-started/overview.md) to set up your new Cloud Manager program and begin managing your Commerce application in a cloud-native environment.

## Commerce guides {#commerce-guides}

The Commerce on Experience Cloud guide assumes that you have some working knowledge and understanding of the Commerce application powered by Magento. You can refer to the Commerce Developer and User guides below:

- [Commerce Developer Guides](https://devdocs.magento.com)\*

- [Commerce User Guides](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide)

>[!TIP]
