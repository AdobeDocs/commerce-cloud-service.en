# Commerce on Cloud Infrastructure

Commerce on cloud infrastructure is a fully managed hosting platform that provides a **self-service** approach to building, deploying, and managing your Commerce application (powered by Magento) in a cloud-native environment. Monolithic applications are resource-intensive and difficult to scale and serve rapidly. With the Adobe Experience Cloud ecosystem, Commerce customers gain unparalleled access to SaaS-based microservices that are rich, intelligent, and performant.

Use the [Commerce Getting Started guide](../getting-started/overview.md) to set up your new console program and begin managing your Commerce application in a cloud-native environment.
