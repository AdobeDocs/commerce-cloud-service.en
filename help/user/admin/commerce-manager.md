# Program administration

A Magento _Commerce program_ is a Cloud Manager interface that helps you to fully manage environments, pipelines, and repositories. There are three distinct roles for working with Magento on AEC.

1. **Admin manager**—As an Admin manager, you can create programs and grant user access from the Admin Console Experience.
1. **Deployment manager**—As a Deployment manager, you can provision and manage multiple programs, manage the CICD process, and schedule builds and deployments.

## First-time login

As part of the onboarding process, Adobe created a product profile for your company and granted permissions for your Admin Manager to begin building an Adobe Commerce program. The Admin Manager for your organization uses the Admin Console to create and manage users.

You received an email granted you permission to access the Adobe Commerce program in Cloud manager.
