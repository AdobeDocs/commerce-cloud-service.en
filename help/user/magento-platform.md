## Magento on Adobe Experience Cloud

The Adobe Commerce Program is a fully managed hosting platform that provides a **self-service** approach to building, deploying, and managing your Magento Commerce application in a Cloud-native environment. From the Commerce Program portal, you control:

- Performance monitoring
- Environment access and controls
- CICD Pipeline optimization and scheduling
- Capacity management with autoscale tooling
- Self-service stack configurations
- Multi-application support and micro-services

## The New Adobe Commerce Experience {#compare}
