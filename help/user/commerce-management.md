![Banner](../assets/banner-hex-violet.png)

## Commerce on Experience Cloud Infrastructure

Commerce is on a fully managed hosting platform that provides a **self-service** approach to building, deploying, and managing your Magento Commerce application in a cloud-native environment. From the Commerce Program portal, you control:

- Performance monitoring
- Environment access and controls
- CICD Pipeline optimization and scheduling
- Capacity management with autoscale tooling
- Self-service stack configurations
- Multi-application support and micro-services

## The New Commerce Experience

Use the [Commerce Getting Started guide](../getting-started/commerce-start.md) to set up your new Commerce program and begin managing your Commerce application in a cloud-native environment.

## Magento Commerce guides {#magento-guides}

The Commerce guides assume that you have some working knowledge and understanding of the Magento Commerce application. You can refer to the Magento Commerce Developer and User guides below:

- [Magento Commerce Developer Guides](https://devdocs.magento.com)

- [Magento Commerce User Guides](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide)
