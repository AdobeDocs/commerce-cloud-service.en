## Commerce on Adobe Experience Cloud Infrastructure

Adobe Commerce is on a fully managed hosting platform that provides a **self-service** approach to building, deploying, and managing your Magento Commerce application in a cloud-native environment. From the Adobe Commerce Program portal, you control:

- Performance monitoring
- Environment access and controls
- CICD Pipeline optimization and scheduling
- Capacity management with autoscale tooling
- Self-service stack configurations
- Multi-application support and micro-services

## The New Adobe Commerce Experience

Use the Commerce Getting Started guide to set up your new Commerce program and begin managing your Commerce application in a cloud-native environment.
