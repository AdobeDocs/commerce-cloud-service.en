# Access your Commerce Admin panel

Users that have administrative access to the Commerce Admin panel can add users, configure store services, complete store setup and customization work, and more.

For a new project, the first step after receiving the welcome email is to secure Admin access to the project by changing the password on the License Owner account. The default username for this account is the License Owner email address.

You can submit a password change request using either of the following methods:

- Locate the welcome email sent to the License Owner email address and follow the link and change your password.

- Copy the store URL from the [Cloud Console](../cloud-guide/project/overview.md) into a browser. Then, append `/admin` to the end of the URL to open the sign-in page. Click the **Forgot password?** link to send a password change request to the License Owner email address.

After you submit the password change request, check your email for the password reset notification. If you do not get the email, check your spam folder.

>[!TIP]
>
>If the password reset fails or you cannot sign in to the Admin panel, a user with admin access can connect to the project using SSH and add an admin user using the `admin:user:create` CLI command. See [Create, edit, or unlock an administrator account](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/installation-guide/tutorials/admin.html) in the _Installation guide_.
