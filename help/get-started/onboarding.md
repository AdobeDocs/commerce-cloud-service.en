# Onboarding to Commerce

After Adobe provisions a Commerce on cloud infrastructure subscription, initial project and code access is available only to the person designated as the License Owner (Account Owner).

The License Owner is the person in your business or finance organization that manages payments and other business-related issues for the Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure account. This person serves as the point of contact with Adobe.

To quickly onboard your project, so you can begin developing your site for live deployment, you must complete required setup and onboarding tasks. Typically, the License Owner begins the process by securing Admin access and creating Technical Admin users that can help with setup, customization, and development work.

If you need to change the License Owner on your account, you must contact your Adobe Commerce Customer Success Manager.
Sign up for a Cloud account. If you do not have an Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure account, contact Sales. We create your account and send you a welcome email that provides instructions to access the project.

The person who signs up for an Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure account is referred to as the License Owner.
