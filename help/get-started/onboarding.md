# [!DNL Onboarding] to Commerce

After Adobe activates a Commerce on cloud infrastructure subscription, the initial project and code access is available only to the person designated as the License Owner (Account Owner).

The License Owner is the person in your business or finance organization that manages payments and other business-related transactions for the Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure account. This person serves as the point of contact with Adobe. If you must change the License Owner on your account, you must contact your Adobe Account Team.

To quickly onboard your project, so you can begin developing your site for live deployment, you must complete the required setup and [!DNL onboarding] tasks. Typically, the License Owner begins the process by securing Admin access and creating Admin users that can help with setup, customization, and development work.

## Sign up for a Cloud account

If you do not have an Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure account, contact [Sales][]. When you sign up, Adobe creates your account and sends you a welcome email that provides instructions on how to access the project interface. The email contains a link so that you can log in to your account and complete your initial project setup.

## Access project and add users

The License Owner can add user accounts to provide access to code, manage branches, enter tickets, and support environments. These user accounts can include in-house development, consultants, and solution specialists.

### User registration

You can only add registered users to your Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure projects and environments. If you have a new user, ask them to [register for an account](https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login/) and to provide the email address associated with their account profile.

### Shared account access

The License Owner can set up shared access for the account. Shared access allows trusted employees and service providers to use the Help center to submit and track Support tickets related to your Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure projects. For setup instructions, see the [Shared Access][] article in the Help Center.

### [!DNL Cloud Console]

You can use the [[!DNL Cloud Console]](cloud-console.md) to manage your project, add user accounts, and begin developing your store. The License Owner, Technical Admin users, and developers can use the [!DNL Cloud Console] to manage all environments and branches, environment variables, environment settings, and routes.

## Sign up for Adobe status

Get updates about Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure platform environments and related services from the [Status page][].

The page provides a status for Adobe Commerce components and services followed by notifications about incident reports, service upgrades, planned outages, and scheduled maintenance. Anyone working on your project can subscribe to the Adobe Commerce status site to receive event notifications and updates through email or Slack. You can customize your Adobe status subscription to track specific products by regions and events.
