# Get Started with Adobe Commerce on Cloud

Welcome to Adobe Commerce!

The Get Started section steps you through the procedures to initialize your Adobe Commerce account and access the Cloud Project UI. The _Next step_ link at the bottom of each topic opens the next concept and procedure. Each topic builds on the previous topics with new tasks and learning links.

This guide assumes that you have some working knowledge and understanding of the Commerce application. You can refer to the latest Commerce Developer and Commerce User guides:

- [Adobe Commerce Developer Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/docs/) (Adobe Developer site)—Develop, customize, integrate, extend, and use advanced capabilities 

- [Adobe Commerce Documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce.html) (Adobe Experience League)—Plan, implement, operate, upgrade, and maintain your Commerce projects
