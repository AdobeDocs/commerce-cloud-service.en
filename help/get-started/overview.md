# Get Started

Welcome to Adobe Commerce!

Getting Started steps you through procedures to initialize your Commerce account and access the Cloud console UI. The _Next step_ link at the bottom of each topic opens the next concept and procedure. Each topic builds on the previous topics with new tasks and learning links.

This guide assumes that you have some working knowledge and understanding of the Commerce application powered by Magento. You can refer to the latest Commerce Developer and Commerce User guides:

- [Adobe Commerce Developer Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/docs) (Adobe Developer site)—Develop, customize, integrate, extend, and use advanced capabilities 

- [Adobe Commerce Documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce.html) (Adobe Experience League)—Plan, implement, operate, upgrade, and maintain your Commerce projects
