# Import existing Commerce code

Adobe recommends that you create a Commerce on cloud infrastructure project from a blank template or by importing existing code. We recommend starting with a blank template first, and then importing existing code into the new project. This ensures that you have all the necessary files to support the project.

The complete workflow for importing existing code includes the following steps:

- Replace the template code
- Import database and media content
- Clear the cache and verify import
