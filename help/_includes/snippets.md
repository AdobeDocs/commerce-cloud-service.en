## Update to ece-tools {#ece-tools-package}

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you use a version of Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure that does not contain the `ece-tools` package, then you must perform a one-time [upgrade](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/project/ece-tools-upgrade-project.html) to your cloud project to remove deprecated packages. If you currently use the `ece-tools` package and you need to update it, see [Update ece-tools version](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/project/ece-tools-update.html).
